# BoardGameAnalysis

## Introduction

It is undeniable fact that board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic board games, like Scythe or Catan have become hugely popular all over the world. In Greece there are many associations and “fan clubs” of popular board games, which they organized many tournaments with many participants and a rich variety of awards. 
Most game designers have full time jobs and creating games is merely their hobby (yes, even for popular games!). They typically only make enough profit to break even or at best squeeze out a couple expansions.
That is, until Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform that helps bring creative projects to life. Kickstarter has been revolutionary to the board game market, as it gives avid gamers a chance to put their idea out in front of other like minded people. It gave the table top community a way to bring silent ideas to life. 
Based on the above reasons, this assignment is an excellent opportunity to study and analyze a huge dataset of board games, so as to investigate which attributes and users’ stats exactly define a successful and popular board game.
We are going to use SQL Server Database to define our schema, to design and develop our data warehouse. Moreover we are going to use SQL Server Analysis Services to define our multi-dimensional model over our schema. Furthermore we will connect our cube to Tableau and we are going show some OLAP reports and visualize the most interesting results. 
At last, we are going to create a linear regression model through IBM SPSS Statistics Platform, to make predictions for newly created board games and to understand which stats from BGG community and main attributes of games affect the rating of a game more.
Our main approach to this report, in exploring the BoardGameGeek (BGG) dataset, will be an effort on trying to answer the question “Wouldn’t it be nice to know if a board game is good before you buy it?” This is a very broad question and cannot be answered without a deep knowledge of the data itself.
